This repository contains the exams (with solutions) for an introductory course on graph theory which I taught in Spring 2013. The topics covered correspond roughly to the first eight chapters of the book "Introduction to Graph Theory" by Gary Chartrand and Ping Zhang. Some of the topics covered:

* trees
* [minimum spanning trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree)
* connectivity: cuts, blocks, [Menger's theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger%27s_theorem)
* [Eulerian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path) and [Hamiltonian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path) graphs
* [matchings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_%28graph_theory%29) in bipartite graphs
